# 🚀 `UART virtual com ports communication `
![Serial](images/serial.jfif)

#### <i> 💡 Overview </i> <br>

<span>This project is a pure C implementation for UART communication. The program receives data via UART, calculates various metrics (average data transfer speed, size of received data, and CRC16 checksum), and sends this information back over UART. </span>

###  Features  <br>

- ✅<b>Data Reception and Transmission:</b>Receives data through a virtual COM port and sends back calculated metrics.
- ✅<b>Average Data Transfer Speed:</b> Calculates and returns the average speed of the data transfer.
- ✅<b>Data Size Reporting:</b> Provides the size of the received data.
- ✅<b>CRC16 Error Checking:</b> Implements CRC16 checksum to ensure data integrity. <br>

## <span> 🔎 Tested Environment </span>

<span> First of all if you're using Windows you need to install [Null-Modem Emulator](https://sourceforge.net/projects/com0com/) to see <i> active virtual pair ports on your computer <i> </span> <br>
